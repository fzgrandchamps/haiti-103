The dish is particularly associated with the Haitian Revolution, which began in 1791 and ended in 1804 with the establishment of Haiti as the world\u0026rsquo;s first black republic. According to legend, the soup was once a delicacy reserved for the French colonizers and was prohibited for enslaved Haitians to consume. However, on January 1st, 1804, Haiti declared its independence, and the first thing the enslaved Haitians did was to cook and enjoy a bowl of soup joumou as a symbol of their newfound freedom. Today, the soup is widely considered to be a national dish and is enjoyed by Haitians on New Year\u0026rsquo;s Day and other special occasions. It\u0026rsquo;s made with beef, vegetables such as carrots, onion, and potatoes, and of course, pumpkin.
