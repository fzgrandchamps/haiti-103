The Black Jacobins is a historical account of the Haitian Revolution, written by C.L.R. James. The book describes the revolution as a culmination of decades of resistance by enslaved Africans and Afro-Caribbeans against the French colonial regime in Saint-Domingue, now Haiti. James argues that the revolution was not only a slave rebellion, but also a social revolution that transformed the colony and the world. He also highlights the role of Toussaint L'Ouverture, a former slave who emerged as the leader of the rebellion and the father of Haiti's independence. The book also explores the impact of the revolution on the wider world, particularly on the politics of slavery and colonialism. Overall, The Black Jacobins is a seminal work of history that explores the complexity of the Haitian Revolution and its significance to the history of the world.
